The  UK Government's Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 requires Parish Councils (PCs) to publish their operations on a website. Many councils rose enthusiastically to the challenge and a rich assembly of websites quickly appeared.

Sadly, however, enthusiasm may have waned since then. 

For one thing, while developing a website is fun, maintaining it subsequently is a chore. In the case of Parish Council sites, new information arises in a continuous stream and, once the original site developers have moved on to fresh, more exciting projects, the job of maintenance falls to individuals with less interest in technical matters and fewer skills.

Meanwhile, the range and depth of skills required to deliver a professional website has broadened and deepened. Whereas, in the past it would have been sufficient to produce a site that looked good on Windows desktop PCs, one now needs to cater for smaller-screen devices such as Apple iPhones. This may represent a considerable technical challenge.  At the same time, the range of government requirement has steadily widened. The latest iteration has introduced a demand for "accessibility". Websites are now required to be usable by individuals with limb and eyesight disabilities. These are worthy aspirations but difficult to deliver because the sort of technology required is not entirely straightforward. It is likely that many Parish Councils will opt to subcontract the work to commercial third parties, with consequent financial implications.

This writer's view is that, in many cases, it is likely that a Parish Council experiencing difficulties with its website is likely to be a victim of its own initial enthusiasm. Many PC websites are simply too complex. The job required by Government was quite simple but most Parish Council sites went far beyond the original brief. There are other places to build additional this sort of functionality (eg Wikipedia) and, significantly, these are places that are not subject to legal regulation. 

Ah well. IThis site may be of interest to  Parish Councils who eiher still need to write a website or are perhaps thinking of replacing an existing site. It provides, free of charge, a framework of code that can be used to create quickly a Parish Council website stripped to the essentials. "Accessibiity" is built-in and templates are provided for some of the essential documents that the website must carry. A configuration and maintenance facility ensures that initial configuarion and subequent maintenance operations are delivered with an absolute minimum of effort.

An example of an operational website produced by an early version of the framework is viewable at https://milburnparishcouncil.co.uk/. As you'll see the style is austere but effective. The opening carousel provides sufficient "personalisation" to convey the character of the Council's community but the site concentrates on providing a clear and simple mechanism for accessing the legally-required information. The site is basically just a curated list of links to reference documents (pdf files). Configuration and maintenance of the site - ie the creation and maintenance of the site framework and the upload of the referenced files - is delivered by a site-update facility. Operation of the system thus require requires little more skill than the ability to produce word-process documents and turn these into pdf files. 

Meanwhile, the site meets requirements for "accessibility" and works well on both large and small-screen device in conjunction with all modern web-browser platforms.
